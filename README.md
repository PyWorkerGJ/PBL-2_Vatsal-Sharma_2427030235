Smart Resource Booking & Management System
Project Overview
The Smart Resource Booking & Management System is a web-based solution designed to optimize the allocation and utilization of organizational resources such as rooms, equipment, personnel, and shared infrastructure.

The system addresses inefficiencies caused by manual booking processes and provides a structured, transparent, and automated mechanism for managing resource availability.

Problem Statement
Many organizations experience frequent resource conflicts and underutilization. Manual booking systems often result in:

Double bookings
Delays in project execution
Increased administrative overhead
Reduced employee satisfaction
Poor visibility into resource usage
There is a need for a centralized digital system that ensures efficient, real-time, and policy-driven resource allocation.

Proposed Solution
The Smart Resource Booking System provides a digital framework that enables:

Automated scheduling
Real-time availability tracking
Intelligent conflict detection
Approval workflow management
Calendar synchronization
Utilization analytics
The goal is to ensure the right resource is allocated at the right time while minimizing operational inefficiencies.

System Methodology
1. Dataset / Input
The system processes structured data including:

Resource inventory (rooms, equipment, personnel)
Booking requests
